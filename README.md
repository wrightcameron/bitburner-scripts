# BitBurner Scripts Repository

This repoistory is storage for scripts used within video game [BitBurner](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812820/Bitburner/)

As there is no source control or way to organise scripts into directories in the video game BitBurner I am storing them here.

## Requirements

Download the game BitBurner on Steam
